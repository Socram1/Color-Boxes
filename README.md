# Color Boxes

Color Boxes is a simple web application that allows you to hover over boxes and change their background color to a random color. It's a fun and interactive project that lets you see different colors generate every time you hover over a box.

## Installation

To use the Color Boxes application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

You can now interact with color boxes!

## Usage

When you open the Color Boxes application in your web browser, you will see a grid of boxes. Hover over any box, and its background color will change to a random color thanks to the hexadecimal value function. The box will also have a white box shadow effect.

If you move the mouse pointer away from the box, the box shadow effect will be removed.

## Customization

You can customize the Color Boxes application to suit your needs. Here are some possible modifications:

- Box Size: You can adjust the size of the boxes by modifying the `height` and `width` properties in the CSS style for the `.box` class.

- Background Color: By default, the boxes have a background color of `blueviolet`. If you want to change the initial background color, you can modify the `background-color` property in the CSS style for the `.box` class.

- Box Shadow: The box shadow effect is applied when you hover over a box. You can modify the shadow effect by changing the `box-shadow` property in the JavaScript code.

- Number of Boxes: The current implementation includes a grid of 100 boxes. You can add or remove boxes by modifying the HTML code. Simply duplicate or delete the `<div class="box"></div>` elements as needed.

- Sound of Boxes: Add sounds to each individual box when you hover over one. Making the project even more interactive and fun!
